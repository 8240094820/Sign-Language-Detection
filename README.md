# Sign-Language-Detection

Developed a sign language detection system using Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and machine learning. The project involved extracting hand landmarks from static gesture images, preprocessing and normalizing the data, and training a Random Forest classifier for accurate recognition of alphabets, numbers, and symbols. The model was exported for real-time predictions and can be extended with new gestures easily.

Tools Used: Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pickle
